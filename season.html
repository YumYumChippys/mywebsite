    <h1>Why I Enjoy Summer</h1>
    <p>
        Summer is my favorite season because the days are longer and filled with sunshine. 
        I enjoy spending time outdoors, and we normally go to new places and try many new things in summer. 
        The warm weather makes it easy to plan fun activities with friends and family. 
        I love going to places such as Universal Studios, the beach, and the movies with my family.
        Summer also brings exciting holidays like Independence Day, which I celebrate with fireworks and home feasts. 
        Summer also brings the useful oppurtunity to prepare for my next school year and get ahead.
        The season feels carefree and joyful,and is a long, much-needed break from school.
        Overall, summer gives me energy and happiness that lasts all season long.
